Description: Generates lifespans and fertility histories in continuous time using individual-level state transition (multi-state) models and data from the Human Mortality Database and the Human Fertility Database. To facilitate virtual population analysis, data on virtual individuals are stored in a data structure commonly used in sample surveys. Life histories are generated for multiple generations. The genealogies that result facilitate the study of family ties.
